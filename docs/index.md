![workflow](./img/home/00_Architecture.png)

- Started with PSO implementation for weights extraction. But failed to implement it.
    - [PSO Implementation](./pso.md)

- Following Bottom Up approach, started with working on Quantiation of models and LLMs.
    - Quantized open source models using open source methods.
    - Implemented 8-bit Modality Agnostic Quantizer.
    - Read [Quantization](./Quantization.md) Doc for more.

- Implemented characterwise GPT model to understand the GPT structure.
    - Read [GPT Implementation](./gpt.md) Doc for more.
    - Qunatized the Implemented GPT model.

- Working on Finetuning the LLM models
    - [Fine-tuning](./finetuning.md) Documentation.
